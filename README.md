Translate a greek-lettered wordlist to greeklish. May have some dups as some greek words that are written with different greek letters, may produce the same greeklish output.

You can then combine the generated lists with
[wordlister](https://github.com/servomekanism/wordlister) to create male and female
combined lists

Based on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59552782/how-to-convert-characters-from-greek-to-english-python) answer.
